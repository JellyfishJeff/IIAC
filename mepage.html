            <h3>My Records</h3>
            <p>The IIAC provides a cloud storage place for any sort of medically approved files. This allows a patient
                to upload an x-ray image done or just a prespriction from a doctor. Patients will have access to these
                anytime they're logged into IIAC's website.</p>

            <h3>My Medications</h3>
            <p>Knowing the right medication is vital for any sort of patient despite the seriousness of their disease or
                condition. "My medication" helps patients keep track of their medicines and provides details about each
                one; what it does, when it was prescribed, what hospital prescribed it and more. This is helpful for
                patients who visit different institutions so their medical history is clear and concise. </p>

        <section id="myReminders">
            <h3>My Reminders</h3>
            <p>An entry system to create a log of different medications and medical appointments established by the
                patient himself is available here. Reminders are crucial for most people and having a website that
                doesn't only compile all of your medical information in one place but also helps you keep track of your
                conditions to get better is a need in the 21st century. Poeple may have so much going on that they tend
                to forget what matters which is why IIAC got your back. </p>
