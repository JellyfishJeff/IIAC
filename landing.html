                        <p>
                            Different institutions registered undered IIAC can store their loads records for thousands
                            of
                            patients. Gaining premium information about trneding diseases or epidemics, third world
                            countries
                            medical institutions can enhance their programs and services. At IIAC we believe knowledge
                            is
                            power
                            and once trained doctors have access to the knowledge and facilities and tools like this
                            website
                            which they need, they'll be unstoppable. Improving health care services is the primary focus
                            of
                            IIAC
                            as the health care sector is often neglected in developing countries.

                        <p>
                            Medical Institutions having access to every single patient they come across will help build
                            up data for future references. Networking across the globe, institutions can access
                            different databases and effectively help their patients as they have utterly accurate
                            information about the patient they are treating at the second. This will be a future feature
                            of the IIAC as the primary focus is the individual's accessibility to his/her own medical
                            records.
