                        patients. Gaining premium information about trneding diseases or epidemics, third world
                        countries
                        medical institutions can enhance their programs and services. At IIAC we believe knowledge is
                        power
                        and once trained doctors have access to the knowledge and facilities and tools like this website
                        which they need, they'll be unstoppable. Improving health care services is the primary focus of
                        IIAC
                        as the health care sector is often neglected in third world countries.
